# Instructions

The participation component of assessment for ME 701 is entirely driven by
content generated by *you*, the student.  After (and before, as is 
appropriate) each lecture, you are tasked with summarizing three key pieces
of information:

  1. How you prepared for the lecture *prior to* the lecture.
  2. How you contributed to the lecture *during* the lecture.
  3. What was (or remains) the most confusing topic of the lecture.

Included in this repository is a file named `participation.md`.  In it, 
template entries are provided for the first two lectures.  You will fill
these in and add others as we go along.  Eventually, you will make 
"commits" after each lecture and push those commits to your GitHub
repository, which will be reviewed five times during the semester.

As long as you provide the three pieces of information for each lecture,
and do so *thoroughly* and *on time*, you will earn full credit.  Partial
credit will be assigned in cases of gross tardiness and incompleteness.
Remember, one benefit of `git commit` is that it puts a time stamp on each
change made to the repository!

**Note**:  These repositories are private and only visible by you and the 
course personnel.
